                            <p>In the depths of a remote asteroid mining colony, young Jack's mundane existence is shattered when he witnesses a mysterious execution and recovers a strange device from the victim's pocket. This single act of curiosity catapults him into an adventure beyond anything he could have imagined.</p>
<p>As Jack explores forgotten tunnels and discovers ancient technology, he forms an unlikely alliance with Aggie, a brilliant entity with secrets of her own. Together, they hatch a daring escape plan from the megacorporation's brutal grip.</p>
<p>But when tragedy strikes, Jack must navigate a universe he never knew existed, full of both wonder and danger. With only his wits and his new companion to guide him, he embarks on a journey that will challenge everything he thought he knew about freedom, humanity, and himself.</p>
<p>In a world where artificial intelligence is hunted and corporations rule with iron fists, some treasures are worth any risk—and some freedoms cannot be stolen.</p>

                            <h3>Setting</h3>
                            <p>Stolen Freedom unfolds across a bleak yet expansive universe dominated by megacorporations. The story begins in the claustrophobic confines of an asteroid mining colony—a place of perpetual darkness, harsh discipline, and indentured servitude. Here, workers toil endlessly to extract resources while living in spartan conditions under the watchful eyes of security guards.</p>
<p>As the narrative progresses, the setting expands dramatically to include the vast emptiness of space itself, with its breathtaking vista of stars, and eventually Horizon Outpost—a bustling space station that serves as a haven free from direct corporate control. This stark contrast between oppressive confinement and the boundless potential of space mirrors Jack's own journey from restriction to possibility.</p>
<p>The technology depicted ranges from the primitive and worn equipment of the mining colony to the advanced VoidSuits, courier ships, and quantum communication systems that populate the wider universe, creating a layered world that feels both familiar and fantastical.</p>

                            <h3>Excerpt</h3>
                            <p>Jack hung there, an insignificant dot at the end of a line hanging off the outside of a huge spinning rock in the middle of nowhere. He looked at the dazzling array of multicoloured stars and other spaceborne bodies, and he felt his body begin to relax.</p>
<p>"I am in position, Jack, and you are coming around to the release point. Are you ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Aggie. I am ready."</p>
<p>A few seconds passed in silence, then suddenly Jack was weightless. Aggie had instructed the VoidSuit to release and retract the hook from which Jack had been dangling and he was now in freefall. He tried to reorientate himself to try and face his direction of travel, but no matter what he tried, his orientation persisted—head towards the asteroid, feet towards the void.</p>
<p>"Jack, are you OK?" Aggie almost sounded concerned.</p>
<p>"I can't see you, Aggie. Where are you?" an edge of worry had crept into Jack's voice.</p>
<p>"I am right below you, Jack. You are on a perfect trajectory and I am holding position ready to catch you. Impact in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, contact."</p>
