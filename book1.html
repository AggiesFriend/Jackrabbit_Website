                            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                            <p>In a future where humanity has spread across the stars, the Unified Planetary Fleet maintains order with an iron grip. When decorated pilot Alex Mercer discovers corruption at the highest levels of the Fleet, he finds himself framed for a crime he didn't commit and sentenced to a prison colony.</p>
                            <p>After a daring escape, Alex becomes the reluctant leader of a growing resistance movement. Joined by brilliant scientist Elena Vega and skilled navigator Maya Lin, Alex must use his knowledge of Fleet operations to strike back against the oppressive regime led by his former mentor, Commander Darius.</p>
                            <p>As the resistance gains momentum, they discover that the struggle for freedom may have stakes far beyond their immediate conflict—ancient technologies and forgotten histories begin to emerge, hinting at a deeper conspiracy that could change the course of human civilization.</p>
                            <p>The resistance's first major victory comes at a heavy cost, forcing Alex to confront difficult questions about leadership and responsibility. Meanwhile, the mysterious arrival of Zephyr, a figure with knowledge of ancient technologies, adds a new dimension to their struggle.</p>
                            <p>As the first book in The Jackrabbit series concludes, the resistance establishes itself as a formidable force, but Commander Darius's response makes it clear that their fight for freedom has only just begun.</p>

                            <h3>Setting</h3>
                            <p>Stolen Freedom takes place approximately 300 years in the future, in a time when humanity has colonized dozens of star systems. The story spans multiple locations:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>New Terra:</strong> The capital planet of human civilization and headquarters of the Unified Planetary Fleet.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tarsus IV:</strong> A mining colony where Alex Mercer grew up, now under strict Fleet control.</li>
                                <li><strong>The Outlands:</strong> A collection of frontier worlds and space stations where the resistance finds its first allies.</li>
                                <li><strong>The Jackrabbit:</strong> The modified scout vessel that becomes the resistance's primary ship and the namesake of the series.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="book-section">
                            <h3>Excerpt</h3>
                            <p>The ship shuddered as another blast struck its shields. Alex's hands flew across the controls, making adjustments faster than the onboard AI could calculate them. The Jackrabbit wasn't designed for combat—it was a scout vessel, built for speed and stealth, not for taking on a Fleet destroyer.</p>
                            <p>"Shields at thirty-eight percent," Maya called from the navigation console. Her voice was steady, but Alex could hear the tension beneath it.</p>
                            <p>"We need another two minutes to complete the calculations," Elena said, her fingers dancing across the quantum drive interface. "If we jump without proper coordinates—"</p>
                            <p>"We'll be scattered across three star systems. I know." Alex banked hard to port, narrowly avoiding another barrage. "Just hurry."</p>
                            <p>On the viewscreen, the massive silhouette of the destroyer loomed against the starfield. Commander Darius wouldn't be on that ship—he never did his own dirty work—but his influence was there in the relentless pursuit, the textbook tactics that Alex himself had once studied.</p>
                            <p>It was almost funny, in a bitter way. Everything Darius had taught him was now being used against his former mentor. Every evasive maneuver, every counter-tactic—they were all lessons from the Academy.</p>
                            <p>The ship rocked again.</p>
                            <p>"Shields at twenty-two percent," Maya updated. "Alex, we can't take much more of this."</p>
                            <p>Freedom had a price. Alex had always known that. He just hadn't expected to be the one paying it.</p>
