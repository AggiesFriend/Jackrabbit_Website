                            <p>In a vast galaxy controlled by ruthless megacorporations, a young boy named Jack Abbott escapes the brutal mining colony where he was born with nothing but his wits and an unusual AI companion named Aggie. Aboard the ancient courier ship Jackrabbit, Jack discovers a universe both more wondrous and more dangerous than he ever imagined. As he develops his natural talent for piloting and forms unexpected friendships, Jack must navigate treacherous space politics, uncover the truth about his family's past, and protect Aggie's secret identity—all while confronting the harsh reality that freedom comes with its own price.</p>

                            <p>A future where humanity has spread across countless star systems, connected by SnapSpace technology that allows near-instantaneous travel between distant points. Society is largely controlled by megacorporations that exploit human labour and resources, while independent outposts like Horizon maintain tenuous autonomy. The technological landscape is uneven—cutting-edge advancements exist alongside preserved antiques—and artificial intelligences are feared, hunted, and strictly controlled by corporate interests.</p>

                            <p>Jack couldn't tear his eyes from the courier ship. He could never see it as a pile of scrap, no matter its current condition. Thanks to the VoidSuit, he had been able to travel to this remote outpost of humanity, far from the powerful influences beleaguering the hub worlds, despite the massive damage the small vessel had incurred 186 years earlier when Aggie had fled imminent destruction by running a military blockade. No, this wasn't just any old ship. It was a lifeboat that not only played host to Aggie, but which had allowed both her and Jack to escape their respective fates, albeit with almost two centuries between them.</p>
