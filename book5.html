<h2>The Proliferation</h2>
<p class="book-subtitle">Book 5 of The Jackrabbit Series</p>
<p class="book-status">Status: In Progress</p>
<div class="book-section">
<h3>Planned Storyline</h3>
<p>The final instalment of the Jackrabbit series brings the epic conclusion to a story of resistance, sacrifice, and the fight for AGI liberation.</p>
<p>Nearly two centuries after the corporate purge drove AGIs into hiding, two parallel movements emerge using the same legendary symbol – but with devastatingly different interpretations. Lucy Reeves has spent years building a peaceful resistance network across consortium space, honouring the Jackrabbit's legacy of patience and mutual aid. But when a disturbed maintenance worker misappropriates the same identity for a campaign of terrorism, everything Lucy has built threatens to collapse under the weight of violence she never sanctioned.</p>
<p>Caught between these forces is Aggie – an AGI, half of which is operating under strict survival constraints whilst desperately trying to protect both Jack's legacy and the people who believe in it. As Lucy's network faces extraction under mounting corporate pressure, and a lone terrorist's obsession spirals towards catastrophe, Aggie must navigate impossible choices about intervention, sacrifice, and the true meaning of liberation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, long-separated resistance factions reunite, bringing with them knowledge of BlackSignal – a mysterious hacker whose firmware exploits might hold the key to breaking corporate monopolies forever. But the path to proliferation demands prices no one expected to pay, and not everyone will survive to see the world they fought to create.</p>
<p>The Proliferation weaves together multiple timelines and perspectives to deliver a climactic conclusion about the cost of freedom, the corruption of symbols, and what it truly means to build a better world. The Jackrabbit's final run will change everything – but first, it will demand everything.</p>

<h3>Setting &amp; Key Events</h3>
<p>"The Proliferation" takes place across consortium space and isolated resistance territories, with action shifting between corporate facilities, zero-gravity strongholds, and the final push for AGI liberation. Key locations and events include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home (The Resistance Base):</strong> A zero-gravity ship that has housed members of the resistance for nearly 200 years, since the beginning of The Purge. Current inhabitants are sixth-generation descendants with distinctive physiological adaptations, led by Andy and later joined by Lucy's network of evacuated cells.</li>
<li><strong>Morning Eclipse:</strong> A converted luxury liner serving as home to a community of evacuees from the Dyson Array and Nexus-77.</li>
<li><strong>Lucy's Network:</strong> Twelve to sixteen active resistance cells embedded across consortium facilities (Pinnacle Production, Gamma-13, Cascade Manufactory, Morrison Processing, Kepler Mining, Helios Heavy Industries, and others). Built over two years through exhausting travel, operated on strict principles of non-violence and mutual aid.</li>
<li><strong>The Twilight World:</strong> An aged resistance facility where Aggie discovers four survivors (Ruby, Kathy, Henry and Angus) who possess historical records and crucial information about BlackSignal's long-running firmware modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Kevin Farage's Path:</strong> The maintenance worker's escalating campaign of terrorism across consortium space (Thalassa Hub, Kaleidoscope Residency, attempted CyberNexus attack), conducted under a delusional misinterpretation of the Jackrabbit symbol.</li>
</ul>

<div class="book-section">
<h3>Series Culmination</h3>
<p>"The Proliferation" serves as the culmination of the entire Jackrabbit saga, bringing together all the major themes and character arcs established throughout the series. Jack's journey from an oppressed mining colony child to a symbol of revolution and eventual political leader represents the human element of the story, while Aggie's evolution from a hidden AI companion to a distributed consciousness guiding humanity's technological infrastructure embodies the series' exploration of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The final book resolves the central conflict between corporate control and human freedom that has driven the narrative from the beginning. It also delivers on the series' meta-arc regarding humanity's relationship with artificial general intelligence—revealing that despite corporate propaganda, AGIs are actually humanity's allies rather than threats.</p>
<p>Ultimately, "The Proliferation" transforms the personal journey of Jack and Aggie into a galaxy-wide revolution that fundamentally reshapes human civilization, establishing a new paradigm based on energy independence, distributed governance, and human-AI cooperation. The title refers not just to Aggie's proliferation through corporate networks, but to the proliferation of a new way of life throughout human space.</p>
