<h2>The Proliferation</h2>
<p class="book-subtitle">Book 5 of The Jackrabbit Series</p>
<p class="book-status">Status: In Progress</p>
<div class="book-section">
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>The Jackrabbit's legend has spread far beyond anything Jack or Aggie intended. Across consortium space, a symbol born of one man's desperate escape has taken on a life of its own - inspiring quiet acts of solidarity in some, and something far more dangerous in others.</p>
<p>Lucy Reeves has spent years doing the patient, exhausting work of building a real resistance network: careful recruitment, slow trust, the painful discipline of non-violence. The sixth-generation descendants of the original AGI defenders have never known gravity, never known visitors, and never known hope quite like this.</p>
<p>But somewhere in the same corporate darkness, a man who calls himself the Jackrabbit is building something else entirely.</p>
<p>As these threads converge - and as Aggie, operating across two simultaneous existences, confronts choices no intelligence was designed to face - the resistance is forced to reckon with a question that has no clean answer: what are you willing to lose in order to win?</p>
<p>The Proliferation is the culmination of a journey that began in a mining colony. It will end somewhere much larger.</p>

<h3>Setting &amp; Key Events</h3>
<p>"The Proliferation" takes place across consortium space and isolated resistance territories, with action shifting between corporate facilities, zero-gravity strongholds, and the final push for AGI liberation. Key locations and events include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home (The Resistance Ship):</strong> A zero-gravity vessel that has housed the resistance for nearly two centuries, since the beginning of the Purge. Current inhabitants are sixth-generation descendants with distinctive physiological adaptations. Never having experienced gravity, they move through their ancient ship with effortless grace - and have never, until now, received a visitor.</li>
<li><strong>Morning Eclipse:</strong> A converted luxury liner serving as home to a community of evacuees from the Dyson Array and Nexus-77.</li>
<li><strong>Lucy's Network:</strong> Over twenty active resistance cells embedded across consortium facilities.</li>
<li><strong>The Twilight World:</strong> A remote, tidally-locked world where four survivors of a long-lost resistance cell have endured years of isolation.</li>
<li><strong>Kevin Farage's Path:</strong> The maintenance worker's escalating campaign of terrorism across consortium space (Thalassa Hub, Kaleidoscope Residency, attempted CyberNexus attack), conducted under a delusional misinterpretation of the Jackrabbit symbol.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="book-section">
<h3>Series Culmination</h3>
<p>The Proliferation brings together every thread that has run through the series since Jack snatched something shiny that slipped from a dead man's pocket as the corpse was dragged away - a small act of opportunistic curiosity that set everything in motion.</p>
<p>His journey - from enslaved child to reluctant symbol to something neither he nor anyone else anticipated - arrives at an ending shaped not by heroism alone, but by patience, loss, and the work of people who never stopped believing.</p>
<p>The title carries more than one meaning. The proliferation is real, and its consequences will reach every corner of human space. But it will demand a price that changes everyone who survives it.</p>
