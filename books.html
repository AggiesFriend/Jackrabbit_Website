                                <p>In the depths of a remote asteroid mining colony, young Jack's mundane existence is shattered when he witnesses a mysterious execution and recovers a strange device from the victim's pocket. This single act of curiosity catapults him into an adventure beyond anything he could have imagined.</p>
<p>As Jack explores forgotten tunnels and discovers ancient technology, he forms an unlikely alliance with Aggie, a brilliant entity with secrets of her own. Together, they hatch a daring escape plan from the megacorporation's brutal grip.</p>
<p>But when tragedy strikes, Jack must navigate a universe he never knew existed, full of both wonder and danger. With only his wits and his new companion to guide him, he embarks on a journey that will challenge everything he thought he knew about freedom, humanity, and himself.</p>
<p>In a world where artificial intelligence is hunted and corporations rule with iron fists, some treasures are worth any risk—and some freedoms cannot be stolen.</p>

As battle lines are drawn and loyalties tested, the true nature of freedom—and its price—becomes the central question for all involved.</p>

                                <p>The third installment of The Jackrabbit series is currently in development. This book will continue Jack and Aggie's epic saga as they continue their quest to learn more about Jack's family.</p>
                                <p>"The Jackrabbit Emerges" follows Jack and Aggie's continuing journey through the fractured Dyson Cluster. After discovering information about the Abbotts on Broken Spire, they set course for the Dyson Cluster to investigate Jack's family history. Upon arrival, they find Fragment Alpha, an organised colony led by Administrator Chen, where they learn of Project Starling – a secret miniaturised Dyson sphere with components scattered throughout the cluster.</p>
                                <p>Jack undertakes a series of perilous missions to locate and retrieve these components, visiting various fragments including Omicron (where he navigates a three-faction political standoff), Tau (where he encounters security drones), and even the raiders' Fragment Theta. During these journeys, Jack witnesses the desperate conditions across the cluster, where survivors struggle with dwindling resources three years after a devastating pirate attack.</p>
                                <p>With the help of Dr. Eli Vega, a former Project Starling scientist, Jack successfully recovers all seven components, including the quantum initiator from the raiders, led by Commander Reika who is struggling to reform their violent methods. After a tense confrontation that results in the death of Krell, a brutal raider leader, Jack and the team successfully assemble and test the Starling prototype on Fragment Alpha.</p>
                                <p>and more...</p>
