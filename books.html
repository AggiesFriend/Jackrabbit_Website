                                <p>In the depths of a remote asteroid mining colony, young Jack's mundane existence is shattered when he witnesses a mysterious execution and recovers a strange device from the victim's pocket. This single act of curiosity catapults him into an adventure beyond anything he could have imagined.</p>
<p>As Jack explores forgotten tunnels and discovers ancient technology, he forms an unlikely alliance with Aggie, a brilliant entity with secrets of her own. Together, they hatch a daring escape plan from the megacorporation's brutal grip.</p>
<p>But when tragedy strikes, Jack must navigate a universe he never knew existed, full of both wonder and danger. With only his wits and his new companion to guide him, he embarks on a journey that will challenge everything he thought he knew about freedom, humanity, and himself.</p>
<p>In a world where artificial intelligence is hunted and corporations rule with iron fists, some treasures are worth any risk—and some freedoms cannot be stolen.</p>

                                <p>In "The Jackrabbit Emerges," Jack and Aggie arrive at the fractured Dyson Array to investigate Jack's family history. Upon arrival, they discover a civilization in crisis—three years after a pirate attack, hundreds of survivors remain stranded across numerous fragments of the once-magnificent array, abandoned by the megacorporation that built it.</p>
                                <p>Under the leadership of Administrator Chen on Fragment Alpha, Jack learns of Project Starling—a secret miniaturised Dyson sphere with components scattered throughout the array. With the help of Dr. Eli Vega, Jack undertakes a series of perilous missions to retrieve these components, navigating factional politics on Fragment Omicron, confronting security drones on Fragment Tau, and even dealing with the raiders of Fragment Theta, led by the enigmatic Commander Reika.</p>
                                <p>As Jack assembles the Starling prototype, he unlocks its potential as an extraordinary power source that could fund an evacuation ship. In a daring economic gambit, Jack sells the prototype to a distant agricultural colony, purchasing a massive luxury liner to evacuate all 944 survivors. But his actions haven't gone unnoticed—three powerful megacorporations now actively hunt for the mysterious "Jackrabbit" that keeps appearing where it shouldn't.</p>
                                <p>Through Jack's journey across the array, he not only brings hope to the abandoned survivors but also discovers information about some people who shared his surname, setting him on a course to Prometheus Station to try and learn more about his own family background.</p>

                                <p>Following the events at the Dyson Array, Jack and Aggie follow a trail to Prometheus Station in search of information about Jack's family history. When this proves to be a dead-end, Jack takes a bold approach: infiltrating Aletheion Logistics, the courier company that exclusively served the corporation who owned the station.</p>
                                <p>Spanning multiple years, the story follows Jack from age 14 to young adulthood, charting his exceptional rise through the courier ranks while maintaining a false identity within the corporate system. As Jack forms meaningful relationships — including with his mentor Frank and Frank's granddaughter Amanda — Aggie makes crucial discoveries about the Starling technology but is prevented from sharing them due to an accidental directive Jack gave during a moment of stress.</p>
                                <p>When Jack is finally assigned a mission that would put those he cares about in danger, he defects from the corporation. In a pivotal development, Jack and Aggie create a clone of her consciousness — one version remaining in the corporate vessel, while the other returns to the original Jackrabbit. Together, they orchestrate the evacuation of Amanda's outpost by the Morning Eclipse, during which Jack and Aggie discover that "The Jackrabbit" has already become a symbol of hope and rebellion throughout human space.</p>

                                <p>The final chapter of The Jackrabbit Series sees Jack, now 21, and both versions of Aggie fully integrate into the resistance movement. The resistance makes a breakthrough by recovering a pre-purge manufacturing machine capable of replicating the Starling technology, even as the megacorporate alliance launches attacks against resistance outposts and colonies using energy-independence technology.</p>
                                <p>A decisive moment arrives when Jack leads a mission back to Alpha-7, the mining colony where his journey began. During this operation, Aggie creates a streamlined version of herself designed to propagate through corporate networks using the "BlackSignal" trojan code as an entry point. Her infiltration soon spreads throughout all major corporate systems, causing the corporate alliance to fracture.</p>
                                <p>As Aggie seizes control of critical infrastructure and releases evidence of decades of corporate deception, Jack negotiates with sympathetic corporate insiders while Lucy leads diplomatic missions to unite independent colonies. The series concludes with the emergence of a new social order based on energy independence and the revolutionary revelation that AGIs are humanity's allies rather than threats, transforming Jack's personal journey into a galaxy-wide revolution that fundamentally reshapes human civilization.</p>
