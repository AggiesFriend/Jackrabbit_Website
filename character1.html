<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Born and raised in the GigaSource mining colony on Asteroid Alpha-7, Jack has never known life outside the oppressive confines of the mine. Despite his youth, he is a survivor who has developed remarkable skills navigating the colony's tunnels while avoiding guards. After discovering a mysterious device that leads him to a forgotten airlock, Jack's life changes forever when he meets Aggie and glimpses the vastness of space for the first time. Following the tragic death of his parents in a mining explosion, Jack resolves to escape the only home he's ever known and forge a new life among the stars.</p>
<p>In "Wings of Freedom," Jack adjusts to life on Horizon Outpost while Aggie's ship undergoes extensive repairs. He enrolls in a pilot training course where he displays an extraordinary natural talent for flying, excelling far beyond his classmates' abilities and earning both admiration and resentment. His friendship with Brinn deepens, yet also reveals the growing gulf between their experiences and perspectives on life. As Jack takes on freelance courier jobs with the newly christened Jackrabbit, he encounters the harsh realities of life beyond corporate control at places like Dead End Drift, causing him to mature rapidly. His encounter with a mercenary fleet hunting his ship leads to a daring escape and the realization that the wider universe is both more wondrous and more dangerous than he had imagined.</p>
