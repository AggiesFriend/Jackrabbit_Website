<h2>Foreman Oswald ("Ozzy")</h2>
<p class="role">Supporting Character / Shipyard Foreman</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Ozzy is the experienced, good-natured foreman of the shipyard at Horizon Outpost. With his weathered hands and encyclopedic knowledge of spacecraft, he quickly develops a fondness for both Jack and the ancient courier ship that comes to be named "Jackrabbit." His enthusiasm for working on rare, vintage spacecraft is matched only by his genuine concern for Jack's wellbeing. Beyond his official role repairing and upgrading the Jackrabbit, Ozzy serves as a valuable ally to Jack, connecting him with other useful contacts like Burke and helping him navigate some of the more complex aspects of life at Horizon Outpost.</p>
