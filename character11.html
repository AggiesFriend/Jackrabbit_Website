<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Burke is a hulking, bushy-bearded engineer who operates in the "grey areas" of Horizon Outpost, dealing in modified and refurbished technology that skirts the edges of legality. His workshop is a chaotic jumble of half-finished projects and salvaged components, reflecting his unconventional methods. Despite his intimidating physical presence, Burke shows an unexpected kindness toward Jack, conducting fair business with him and later providing him with illegal quantum-encryption communication devices. His massive hands are capable of extraordinarily delicate work, and he's renowned for being able to fix nearly anything when properly motivated. Burke's connections and technical knowledge make him an invaluable ally for Jack, providing access to technology and services not available through official channels.</p>
