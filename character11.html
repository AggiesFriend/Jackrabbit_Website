                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>Burke is a hulking, bushy-bearded engineer who operates in the "grey areas" of Horizon Outpost, dealing in modified and refurbished technology that skirts the edges of legality. His workshop is a chaotic jumble of half-finished projects and salvaged components, reflecting his unconventional methods. Despite his intimidating physical presence, Burke shows an unexpected kindness toward Jack, conducting fair business with him and later providing him with illegal quantum-encryption communication devices. His massive hands are capable of extraordinarily delicate work, and he's renowned for being able to fix nearly anything when properly motivated. Burke's connections and technical knowledge make him an invaluable ally for Jack, providing access to technology and services not available through official channels.</p>

                                    <p>Burke treats Jack with unexpected respect, seeing beyond his youth to recognize someone who has clearly survived difficult circumstances. He conducts fair business with Jack and later provides him with valuable technology, showing a protective attitude that suggests he's taken a liking to the boy.</p>

                                    <p>Burke's operation exists in a tenuous space within Horizon Outpost's power structure - not entirely legal but tolerated as a necessary element of the station's ecosystem. His presence represents the outpost's relative freedom compared to corporate-controlled locations.</p>
