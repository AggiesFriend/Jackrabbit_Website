<h2>Chas Drayton</h2>
<p class="role">Antagonist / Privileged Pilot Trainee</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>The youngest son of Gordon Drayton, a wealthy businessman whose family helped fund the establishment of Horizon Outpost through their company Horizon Machinery, Chas is an entitled, arrogant youth who takes his privileged position for granted. Tall with scruffy blonde hair, he constantly uses his family name to intimidate others and excuse his own shortcomings. Forced into pilot training by his father in an attempt to instill some discipline and responsibility, Chas resents the entire experience and is particularly threatened by Jack's natural talent, which makes his own mediocrity more apparent. His constant belittling of Jack as "squirt" and attempts to undermine him reveal a deep insecurity beneath his brash exterior.</p>

<h3>Appearances</h3>
<ul class="appearances">
<li><strong>Wings of Freedom</strong> - Chas appears as Jack's primary antagonist during pilot training, constantly belittling him and creating a hostile environment.

<h3>Key Relationships</h3>
<div class="relationships">
<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character1.html">Jack Abbott</a></h4>
<p>Chas immediately identifies Jack as a target for his bullying, dubbing him "squirt" and constantly belittling him. His attitude toward Jack transitions from dismissive to openly hostile as Jack's natural piloting abilities make Chas's own mediocrity increasingly apparent.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4>Gordon Drayton</h4>
<p>Chas's relationship with his father is strained and complicated. Gordon's attempt to instill discipline in his son by forcing him into pilot training creates resentment, yet Chas still relies on his father's name and status when it suits him.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4>Stav and Nigel</h4>
<p>These two young men serve as Chas's lackeys and enablers, following his lead and reinforcing his sense of superiority. Their loyalty, however, begins to waver as Jack's abilities become increasingly apparent and Chas's facade starts to crack.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character9.html">Captain Hale</a></h4>
<p>Chas attempts to use his family's influence to gain preferential treatment from Hale, but the experienced captain refuses to be intimidated, treating Chas with the same high expectations as any other student and calling out his poor performance.</p>

<h3>Connections</h3>
<p>The Drayton surname connects Chas to Victor Drayton, the cruel foreman from the mining colony in Book 1. While their exact family relationship is not explicitly stated, the shared name and similar traits of entitlement and cruelty suggest a family connection that hints at a larger web of power and influence.</p>
