                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>A middle-aged woman in her mid-fifties, Veronica Bennett joins the pilot training program not out of personal ambition but out of a desire to understand her late son Derek's passion for space flight. Quiet and determined despite her obvious anxiety and technical struggles, Veronica develops a maternal bond with Jack, sitting beside him in class and offering him practical advice like wearing double socks to prevent his new boots from chafing. As the training progresses and the challenges become more complex, Veronica eventually recognizes that piloting isn't her path but accepts that her brief experience has given her enough insight into her son's passion to find peace with his memory.</p>
