                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>A self-styled military leader commanding a modest mercenary fleet, Commodore Razer is a calculating and ruthless captain-for-hire who takes on contracts from various clients, including corporate interests. Her flagship, the Gripper, leads a collection of armed vessels that include interceptors and combat-ready ships. Razer's operation demonstrates professional precision combined with opportunistic flexibility, as she's willing to take on morally dubious contracts like intercepting and capturing Jack's vessel and its mysterious cargo. After Jack's unprecedented SnapSpace maneuver, her failure to capture him leads her to create a plausible explanation for her corporate clients rather than admit defeat, showing her political survival instincts.</p>

                                    <p>Razer maintains a professional relationship with her corporate employers, balancing her need for their funding against the demands and expectations they place on her operations. Her willingness to fabricate explanations for failure indicates both her fear of corporate reprisal and her skill at navigating such relationships.</p>

Her inability to capture him despite her overwhelming force foreshadows future conflicts and establishes the Jackrabbit's growing legend.</p>
