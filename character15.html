<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Administrator Mei Chen is the stern but capable leader of Fragment Alpha in the shattered remains of the Dyson Array. Serving as Senior Administrator for the entire array for fifteen years before the pirate attack, Chen's leadership and organizational skills have kept Fragment Alpha functioning at near-optimal efficiency despite being cut off from corporate support for three years.</p>
<p>Chen is known for her no-nonsense approach to problem-solving and her unwavering commitment to the survival of those under her authority. Her focus on structure and order has enabled Alpha to maintain higher standards than other fragments, including functioning hydroponics, manufacturing capabilities, and a disciplined security force. When Jack arrives with news of the Starling project and the possibility of evacuation, Chen sees the strategic value in this opportunity and commits Alpha's resources to the mission, despite initial scepticism.</p>
<p>Prior to the attack, Chen had a personal relationship with Dr. Eli Vega, which ended when he was transferred to another project. The revelation that Vega had been working on Project Starling without informing her created significant tension between them when they were reunited after the attack, though they gradually begin to reconcile as they work together on the evacuation plan.</p>
