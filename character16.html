<h2>General Hardeep Singh</h2>
<p class="role">Supporting Character / Military Commander</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>General Hardeep Singh is the commanding officer of Fragment Alpha's Defence Coalition forces. Despite his advanced age (approaching eighty), Singh maintains an imposing presence with ramrod-straight posture and a meticulous appearance, including his midnight blue turban and spotless uniform bearing Defence Coalition insignia.</p>
<p>Singh has a long military background that predates his service on the Dyson Array. He comes from a family with a history of service â€“ his great-grandfather served during the Alpha Centauri Expansion aboard an Astral Dynamics SD-17 vessel, the same model as Jack's Jackrabbit. This connection creates an immediate bond between Singh and Jack when they first meet.</p>
<p>After the pirate attack that fractured the Dyson Array, Singh played a crucial role in organizing Alpha's defences and maintaining security protocols. His tactical expertise has been instrumental in protecting the fragment from raider attacks over the past three years. When presented with the Starling project and evacuation plan, Singh approaches the situation with a pragmatic military mindset, assessing risks and opportunities with equal measure.</p>

<h3>Key Relationships</h3>

<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character15.html">Administrator Chen</a></h4>
<p>Singh serves as Chen's military advisor and trusted lieutenant. They share a deep professional understanding developed over years of working together, often communicating through subtle glances and gestures rather than words.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character1.html">Jack Abbott</a></h4>
<p>Singh develops a particular fondness for Jack, partly due to the boy's connection to the Astral Dynamics SD-17 ship, which reminds Singh of his great-grandfather's service. He recognises and respects Jack's capabilities despite his youth, providing him with military-grade weapons for Jackrabbit and tactical advice for his missions.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character17.html">Commander Reeves</a></h4>
<p>As her superior officer, Singh trusts Reeves with important operational matters. He later provides her with special orders for the mission to Horizon Outpost, suggesting his strategic thinking extends beyond immediate military concerns to broader philosophical questions about corporate loyalty.</p>
