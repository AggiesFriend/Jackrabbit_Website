<p class="role">Supporting Character / Security Chief</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Commander Lucy Reeves serves as the head of security operations on Fragment Alpha, maintaining order and supervising defensive measures against potential threats. Disciplined and professional, Reeves has a military background and adheres strictly to protocols, which has helped maintain stability on Alpha despite the isolation following the pirate attack.</p>
<p>Initially, Reeves views Jack with scepticism and concern, particularly when he takes risks that she considers unnecessary. Her primary focus is always on the safety and security of Fragment Alpha and its inhabitants. Despite her by-the-book approach, she recognises Jack's unusual talents and comes to respect his contributions to their mission.</p>
<p>During their journey to Horizon Outpost, Reeves reveals a more personal side, sharing her given name (Lucy) with Jack and developing a better understanding of his background. Through conversations about his childhood in the mines, she begins to question her long-held beliefs about corporate benevolence, realizing that her years of loyal service to QuantumGrid may have been in support of a system that exploits rather than protects.</p>
