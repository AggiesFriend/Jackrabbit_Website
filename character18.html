<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Dr. Eli Vega is a brilliant scientist who served as the senior systems engineer for Fragment Psi before the pirate attack. Specializing in quantum flux technology, he was secretly recruited to work on Project Starling, QuantumGrid's classified miniaturized Dyson sphere prototype. Due to strict corporate non-disclosure agreements, he was forbidden from discussing the project with anyone—including Administrator Chen, with whom he had been in a relationship for five years.</p>
<p>When the pirate attack fractured the Dyson Array, Vega found himself stranded on Fragment Psi with thirteen other survivors. For three years, he helped maintain their dwindling resources and life support systems, showing remarkable ingenuity despite increasingly desperate circumstances. Their situation had deteriorated to the point of sleeping in the cold and rationing food to one meal per day when Jack and Aggie rescued them from their dying fragment.</p>
<p>After being brought to Fragment Alpha, Vega's expertise became invaluable to the evacuation plan. His intimate knowledge of Project Starling's components and design allowed for the successful assembly and activation of the prototype. Despite initial tension with Chen over his past secrecy, they gradually begin to rebuild trust as they work toward the common goal of evacuating the cluster's survivors.</p>
