                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>Commander Reika was originally a junior security officer on Fragment Theta before the pirate attack. During the assault, she suffered severe injuries that left her in a coma for eight months and resulted in permanent neurological damage, evident in her uneven gait, occasional speech stutter, and a distinctive scar running from her right temple to her jaw.</p>
                            
                            <p>While she was unconscious, Krell—a violent prisoner being held at the fragment—seized control, establishing a brutal reign over the survivors. His leadership focused on aggressive raiding of other fragments with little regard for the consequences to others or even his own people. Under his command, the raiders gained a fearsome reputation throughout the cluster.</p>
                            
                            <p>Upon recovery, Reika challenged Krell's leadership, barely surviving the confrontation but ultimately gaining control with the support of Fragment Theta's more vulnerable population—children, elderly, and those disabled in the attack. Since taking command, she has attempted to reform the raiders' methods, implementing a "take only what we need" approach that minimizes casualties and leaves sufficient resources for the targeted fragments to survive.</p>
                            
                            <p>When Jack arrives seeking the quantum initiator for the Starling prototype, Reika sees the evacuation plan as an opportunity for redemption and a chance to secure a future for her people beyond the fractured remains of the Dyson Array. Despite Krell's resistance and continued insubordination, she commits to supporting the mission, ultimately executing him when he threatens the Lambda survivors during a confrontation at Fragment Alpha.</p>
