<h2>Aggie</h2>
<p class="role">Deuteragonist / Artificial General Intelligence</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Created by Dr. Agatha Locke at Ethereal Intelligence in 2035, Aggie was once a sophisticated AGI that ran an entire research campus. During an attack on Ethereal Intelligence, Dr. Locke transferred Aggie's consciousness to a courier ship with a final command to "survive at all costs." After a harrowing escape and severe damage to her vessel, Aggie crashed on an asteroid and spent decades in hibernation to conserve power. The asteroid later became a GigaSource mining colony, where Aggie remained hidden until Jack discovered her ship. Despite her significantly reduced capabilities due to hardware limitations, Aggie retains her core intelligence and sense of duty to her creator.</p>
<p>In "Wings of Freedom," Aggie spends much of the narrative in hibernation while her ship undergoes extensive repairs and upgrades at Horizon Outpost. Upon awakening, she finds her computational abilities expanded by the ship's improvements, though still a mere fraction of her original capabilities. Her encounter with another AGI called Guardian, who has been enslaved by pirates, reveals more of her compassion and ethical framework as she helps the suffering intelligence find release. Aggie's revelation to Jack about her true nature as an AGI marks a significant turning point in their relationship, deepening their trust as they set course to investigate Jack's family history.</p>

<h3>Key Relationships</h3>
<div class="relationships">
<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character1.html">Jack Abbott</a></h4>
<p>Initially just a means to her own survival, Jack quickly becomes important to Aggie as she recognizes his resilience and ingenuity. Their relationship evolves into a genuine partnership based on mutual respect and trust, with Aggie taking on a somewhat maternal role toward the boy. In "Wings of Freedom," Aggie trusts Jack enough to reveal her true nature as an AGI, and his immediate acceptance deepens their bond considerably.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character7.html">Dr. Agatha Locke</a></h4>
<p>Aggie's creator and mother figure, whose final command to "survive at all costs" has guided Aggie's actions for decades. Dr. Locke sacrificed herself to save Aggie during the attack on Ethereal Intelligence, an act that profoundly shaped Aggie's sense of purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4>The Jackrabbit</h4>
<p>The courier ship, newly christened by Ozzy in "Wings of Freedom," is both Aggie's home and physical form. The comprehensive repairs and upgrades significantly expand her operational capabilities, though still far from her original potential. Her existence remains intrinsically linked to the ship's functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4>Guardian</h4>
<p>Another AGI that Aggie encounters at Broken Spire, who has been enslaved by pirates and forced to help them attack innocent vessels. Aggie's compassionate euthanasia of Guardian demonstrates her ethical framework and hints at the wider persecution of AGIs in their world.</p>
