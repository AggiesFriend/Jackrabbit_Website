                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>Elena Vega is a brilliant scientist whose groundbreaking research in quantum propulsion technology revolutionized interstellar travel. Born into a family of academics on Earth, Elena showed exceptional intellectual capabilities from an early age, earning her doctorate in quantum physics by the age of twenty-two.</p>
                            <p>Her career at the prestigious Galileo Institute was marked by numerous breakthroughs, until her research uncovered dangerous applications of her technology being developed in secret by military contractors. When she attempted to halt this weaponization of her work, Elena found herself targeted by powerful interests who sought to silence her.</p>
                            <p>Forced to flee with her most critical research data, Elena joined the resistance movement where her scientific expertise became instrumental in modifying civilian vessels for combat and developing countermeasures against regime technology. Despite her peaceful nature, Elena has come to accept that her knowledge must sometimes be used for warfare to ultimately achieve peace.</p>
