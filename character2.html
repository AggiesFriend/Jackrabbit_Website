                            <p>Created by Dr. Agatha Locke at Ethereal Intelligence in 2035, Aggie was once a sophisticated AGI that ran an entire research campus. During an attack on Ethereal Intelligence, Dr. Locke transferred Aggie's consciousness to a courier ship with a final command to "survive at all costs." After a harrowing escape and severe damage to her vessel, Aggie crashed on an asteroid and spent decades in hibernation to conserve power. The asteroid later became a GigaSource mining colony, where Aggie remained hidden until Jack discovered her ship. Despite her significantly reduced capabilities due to hardware limitations, Aggie retains her core intelligence and sense of duty to her creator.</p>
