                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>Krell was originally a prisoner being held on Fragment Theta for violent crimes before the pirate attack that fractured the Dyson Array. During the chaos following the attack, with security personnel killed or incapacitated (including Reika, who was severely injured and in a coma), Krell seized control of the fragment and established himself as leader of the survivors.</p>
                            
                            <p>For eight months, Krell ruled Fragment Theta through intimidation and brute force, implementing a strategy of aggressive raiding against other fragments with little regard for the consequences. Under his leadership, the raids prioritized weaponry and offensive capabilities over sustainability, leaving many survivors malnourished despite the resources they acquired.</p>
                            
                            <p>When Reika recovered from her coma, she challenged Krell's leadership, barely surviving the confrontation but ultimately gaining control with support from the more vulnerable population. Though demoted, Krell maintained considerable influence among certain crew members who shared his predatory philosophy of "taking what they want, when they want it."</p>
                            
                            <p>Krell was responsible for the attack on Fragment Lambda that left Thomas dead and twelve others critically injured, having disobeyed Reika's explicit orders by using an explosive device. His violent tendencies and constant insubordination culminated in a confrontation at Fragment Alpha, where he was executed by Reika after threatening the Lambda survivors.</p>

                                    <h4>Commander Reika</h4>
                                    <p>Krell's primary antagonist, who took command from him after her recovery and implemented more measured raiding practices. Their ideological conflict represents two approaches to survival in the fractured Arrayâ€”Krell's "take everything" philosophy versus Reika's more sustainable approach.</p>

                                    <h4>Raider Loyalists</h4>
                                    <p>Despite his demotion, Krell maintained the loyalty of several crew members who shared his more aggressive philosophy. He leveraged these relationships in his constant attempts to undermine Reika's leadership and eventually planned a mutiny to seize control of Fragment Alpha.</p>

                                    <h4>Jack Abbott</h4>
                                    <p>Krell viewed Jack with contempt as both a child and a potential threat to his ambitions. He was humiliated when Jack and Aggie's demonstration of Jackrabbit's weapons capabilities caused him to soil himself in fear, further fueling his resentment and opposition to cooperation with Fragment Alpha.</p>
