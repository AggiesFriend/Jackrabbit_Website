<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Steve Harman was the Engineering Supervisor on Fragment Omicron before the pirate attack. In the aftermath, as Omicron's society fractured into three competing factions, Steve became second-in-command to Chief Tavas of the Blue Spanner faction, which controlled the docking and manufacturing sectors of the fragment.</p>
<p>Unlike the violent and authoritarian Tavas, Steve maintained a more measured approach to leadership, recognizing that the three factions' interdependence was necessary for survival. For months prior to Jack's arrival, he had been quietly planning to move against Tavas, whose increasingly erratic and violent behavior was destabilizing the fragile balance that kept Omicron functioning.</p>
<p>When Jack arrived seeking the containment vessel for the Starling prototype, Steve saw an opportunity. He secretly helped Jack by providing information and warning him about Tavas's plan to assassinate the other faction leaders. During the meeting where Tavas attempted to carry out this plan, Steve intervened decisively, striking Tavas with his own symbolic blue spanner and helping to permanently end his rule.</p>
<p>After taking leadership of the Blue Spanner faction, Steve adopted a cooperative approach, working with the other faction leaders to consider Fragment Alpha's evacuation plan. His background in engineering and technical expertise made him particularly valuable in understanding the Starling components and their potential.</p>

<div class="relationship">
<h4>Chief Tavas</h4>
<p>Steve served as Tavas's second-in-command while secretly planning to remove him from power. Their relationship was one of surface deference masking deep ideological differences about how Fragment Omicron should be led and how its residents should interact with outsiders.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character1.html">Jack Abbott</a></h4>
<p>Steve quickly recognized Jack as a potential ally in his efforts to depose Tavas. He provided crucial help to Jack, warning him about Tavas's assassination plot and later facilitating the transfer of the containment vessel to support the evacuation plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4>Other Faction Leaders</h4>
<p>After taking control of Blue Spanner, Steve established more cooperative relationships with Chief Marko (Green Gear) and Chief Eliza (Red Hammer), focusing on consensus-building rather than intimidation as a leadership strategy.</p>
