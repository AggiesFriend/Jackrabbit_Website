<h2>Thomas &amp; Marcus</h2>
<p class="role">Supporting Characters / Fragment Lambda Survivors</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Thomas and Marcus were partners for thirty-two years, having first met at the QuantumGrid academy on Leviticus Orbital where Marcus was attempting to learn juggling and Thomas teased him about his technique. Before the pirate attack, they lived and worked on Fragment Lambda, with Thomas serving as a security officer.</p>
<p>After the attack that fractured the Dyson Array, they were among the thirteen survivors on Lambda who managed to seal themselves in a storage area converted into living quarters. Despite dwindling resources and isolation, they maintained their relationship as a source of strength amid the challenges of survival.</p>
<p>When Krell's raiders attacked Fragment Lambda, Thomas instinctively protected the others during an explosion, using his body to shield them from the blast. His security training and protective instincts saved many lives at the cost of his own. Though Thomas initially survived the explosion due to his body armor, he suffered critical injuries and died in Marcus's arms as Jack and Aggie were transporting the Lambda survivors to Fragment Alpha.</p>
<p>Marcus, devastated by the loss of his husband, became the face of the Lambda survivors' grievances against the raiders. His confrontation with Krell at Fragment Alpha triggered the decisive moment when Commander Reika executed Krell for his actions. In his final moments with Thomas, Marcus promised not to let his loss "turn him hard," though his grief clearly transformed into a harder, colder resolve in the aftermath.</p>
