<h2>Mr. Grey</h2>
<p class="role">OmniFab Executive / Antagonist</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Mr. Grey is a high-ranking executive at OmniFab who operates with precise calculation and unwavering determination. He leads the corporation's efforts to locate and recover the Jackrabbit and its mysterious technology. Grey believes the vessel contains pre-purge manufacturing technology that could destabilise the carefully maintained balance between megacorporations.</p>
<p>He orchestrates the investigation from OmniFab headquarters, engaging in tense negotiations with representatives from AetherLink and QuantumGrid while deploying significant resources to find the Jackrabbit. These negotiations reveal the complex power dynamics between the three megacorporations, with each pursuing their own agenda while maintaining a veneer of cooperation.</p>
<p>Grey's composed exterior masks an intense focus on protecting OmniFab's interests, and he is willing to take extreme measures to ensure that potentially disruptive technology remains under corporate control. His methodical approach to the Jackrabbit investigation demonstrates both his strategic thinking and his commitment to maintaining the corporate status quo at any cost.</p>
