<h2>Director Vera Santos</h2>
<p class="role">OmniFab Intelligence Division / Antagonist</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Director Vera Santos heads OmniFab's Intelligence Division, reporting directly to Mr. Grey. She is responsible for coordinating the corporation's search for the Jackrabbit and analysing all information related to the vessel and its technology. Santos was the first to recognise the statistical anomaly when mentions of "Jackrabbit" began appearing across sectors.</p>
<p>Her methodical approach and analytical mind make her invaluable to OmniFab's operation, processing complex data with remarkable efficiency. Santos oversees the corporation's covert operatives and runs the technical analysis of evidence gathered from locations like Halcyon Fields, where she confirmed the presence of pre-purge technology.</p>
<p>While utterly loyal to OmniFab, Santos focuses on facts rather than corporate politics. This data-driven approach sometimes puts her at odds with the more politically-minded executives, but her exceptional analytical capabilities make her too valuable to ignore. Her meticulous reports on the Jackrabbit sightings help shape OmniFab's strategy for locating and neutralizing what they perceive as a significant threat to corporate stability.</p>
