                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>Ms. Blackwood is a senior executive at QuantumGrid who becomes involved in the Jackrabbit situation after Halcyon Fields Colony unexpectedly terminates their energy contract with her corporation. Her fierce protection of QuantumGrid's market interests leads her to launch an aggressive investigation, eventually putting her in direct conflict with OmniFab's Mr. Grey, whom she suspects of corporate sabotage.</p>
                            
                            <p>Blackwood operates with cold efficiency and expects absolute competence from her subordinates. She maintains rigid control of QuantumGrid's Operations Command Centre, coordinating efforts to uncover the nature of Halcyon Fields' new energy source and track down the Jackrabbit. Her confrontational approach to protecting QuantumGrid's interests contrasts with Mercury's subtler manipulations and Grey's calculated strategy.</p>
                            
                            <p>When invited to the inter-corporate meeting by Mercury, Blackwood arrives prepared with specific accusations against OmniFab, reflecting her direct approach to corporate conflict. Unlike her counterparts who focus on acquiring the Jackrabbit technology, Blackwood's primary concern is identifying and eliminating the threat to QuantumGrid's energy market dominance, making her approach more reactive but no less dangerous.</p>

                                    <h4>Mr. Grey (OmniFab)</h4>
                                    <p>Blackwood's relationship with Grey is openly antagonistic, as she directly accuses OmniFab of interfering with QuantumGrid's energy contract at Halcyon Fields. Their interactions are characterized by thinly veiled hostility and mutual distrust.</p>

                                    <p>Blackwood views Mercury with suspicion, particularly after discovering he invited her to the meeting with Grey without informing either party in advance. She recognizes his manipulative tendencies but participates in his schemes when they align with QuantumGrid's interests.</p>

Her treatment of him exemplifies her intolerance for what she perceives as incompetence.</p>
