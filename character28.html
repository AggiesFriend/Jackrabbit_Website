<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Decker serves as Commander Reika's trusted second-in-command among the raiders of Fragment Theta. A tall, heavily muscled man with engineering expertise, he knows every inch of their vessel and every person on the fragment. His combination of technical knowledge and leadership abilities makes him an invaluable asset to the raider community.</p>
<p>When Reika's neurological condition worsens during the evacuation, Decker steps up to coordinate the raiders' role in transporting survivors to the Morning Eclipse. Despite his intimidating appearance, he demonstrates surprising diplomacy and adaptability, working effectively with Lucy Reeves and the other fragment leaders to ensure a smooth evacuation process.</p>
<p>Decker's most significant contribution comes when he discovers data storage modules hidden in their vessel's maintenance areaâ€”modules containing information about the Abbotts that he promptly delivers to Jack. After Reika steps down for medical treatment, Decker formally takes command of the newly christened "Reika's Bravery," honouring his former leader while helping complete the evacuation and guiding the raiders toward a more constructive role within the survivor community.</p>
