                            <p>Commander Darius rose through the ranks of the Unified Planetary Fleet through a combination of tactical brilliance, political savvy, and ruthless ambition. Born into poverty on a mining colony, Darius witnessed firsthand the chaos and suffering that resulted from weak governance and societal disorder.</p>
                            <p>This formative experience shaped his worldview: that order must be maintained at all costs, and that individual freedoms must sometimes be sacrificed for collective stability. After distinguishing himself in the Border Wars, Darius was promoted to Fleet Commander and given unprecedented authority to "maintain peace" across the colonized systems.</p>
                            <p>Under his command, the Fleet transformed from a peacekeeping force into an instrument of oppression. Yet Darius does not see himself as a villainâ€”in his mind, he is the only one willing to make the difficult decisions necessary to prevent civilization from collapsing into anarchy. His genuine belief in his cause makes him all the more dangerous.</p>

                                    <p>Darius was once Alex's mentor and commanding officer, seeing great potential in the young pilot. He views Alex's defection as both a personal betrayal and a dangerous threat due to Alex's intimate knowledge of Fleet operations.</p>
