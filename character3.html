<h2>Victor Drayton</h2>
<p class="role">Antagonist / Mine Foreman</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>The younger son of a senior GigaSource executive, Victor Drayton lived a life of privilege and excess until a catastrophic incident where, while under the influence of hallucinogens, he crashed a land-car into a crowd, killing and maiming several people. Rather than face justice, his father arranged for the charges to be dismissed and exiled him to oversee one of GigaSource's most remote mining colonies. Far from corporate oversight, Drayton has established himself as a brutal dictator over the colony, ruling through fear and executing workers on a whim. His sadistic tendencies, coupled with his paranoia about perceived corporate inspections, make him a dangerous and unpredictable force in the lives of the miners.</p>
