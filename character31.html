<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Amanda Kowalski is a brilliant researcher at CyberNexus, specialising in neural networks and artificial intelligence systems. As Frank Kowalski's granddaughter, she has inherited both his work ethic and intellectual curiosity, channelling these traits into cutting-edge research in computational neuroscience.</p>
<p>Amanda's work at CyberNexus involves developing advanced neural network architectures and studying the intersection between biological and artificial intelligence. Her research is highly regarded within the corporation, and she represents the new generation of scientists pushing the boundaries of AI development.</p>
<p>When Jack Abbott enters her grandfather's life as a mentee, Amanda initially meets him with polite interest. However, as she gets to know Jack, she becomes genuinely attracted to his unique combination of natural talent, determination, and vulnerability. Their relationship develops into something deeper than friendship, with Amanda representing the possibility of a normal, stable life for Jack—something he has never experienced before.</p>
<p>Amanda embodies the path toward domesticity and conventional happiness that Jack has always secretly yearned for but never thought possible. Through her, Jack begins to understand what it means to have someone who cares for him not because of what he can do, but simply because of who he is.</p>
