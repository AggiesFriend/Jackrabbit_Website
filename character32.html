<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Eleanor Kowalski is the heart and soul of the Kowalski family, providing warmth, wisdom, and stability to all who enter her home. As Frank's devoted wife and Amanda's loving grandmother, she has spent decades creating a nurturing environment that stands in stark contrast to the harsh corporate worlds that surround them.</p>
<p>Eleanor possesses the rare gift of making people feel immediately welcome and valued. Her home becomes a sanctuary where genuine care takes precedence over achievement or status. Having supported Frank throughout his thirty-four-year career whilst raising their family, she understands the challenges of balancing professional demands with personal relationships.</p>
<p>When Jack Abbott enters their lives through Frank's mentorship, Eleanor immediately recognises the young man's need for maternal guidance and unconditional acceptance. She provides Jack with his first experience of what a true family feels like—a place where he is valued not for his extraordinary abilities or potential usefulness, but simply for being himself.</p>
<p>Eleanor's influence on Jack extends beyond mere kindness. Through her example, she teaches him about patience, compassion, and the importance of nurturing relationships. Her wisdom helps Jack understand that strength can be found in vulnerability and that asking for help is not a sign of weakness but of trust.</p>
