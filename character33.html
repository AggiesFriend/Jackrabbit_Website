<p class="role">Aletheion Logistics Executive / Antagonist</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Katherine Keller is the Executive Vice President of Aletheion Logistics, representing the cold, calculating face of corporate authority. Having climbed the corporate ladder through decades of ruthless efficiency and political maneuvering, she embodies the institutional power that shapes the lives of employees without regard for their individual humanity.</p>
<p>Keller's approach to management is purely transactional—employees are resources to be optimised, not people to be nurtured. She views exceptional performance as something to be leveraged for corporate advantage rather than celebrated for personal achievement. Her oversight of courier operations is marked by strict adherence to protocols and an unwavering focus on maximising profitability.</p>
<p>When Jack Abbott's extraordinary abilities come to her attention, Keller sees an asset to be exploited rather than a person to be developed. Her decision to promote Jack to Tier 4 courier status is driven entirely by corporate interests, with no consideration for how such rapid advancement might affect him personally. She represents the institutional indifference that treats human potential as just another commodity.</p>
<p>Keller's interactions with subordinates are characterised by professional detachment and barely concealed impatience with anything that doesn't directly serve corporate objectives. She serves as a stark contrast to the warmth and genuine care that Jack experiences with the Kowalski family, highlighting the difference between institutional power and human compassion.</p>
