<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Director Halsey serves as Jack Abbott's direct superior at Aletheion Logistics, occupying a crucial middle-management position between the corporate executives and the working couriers. Unlike the cold detachment of upper management, Halsey demonstrates a more personal interest in the development and welfare of his subordinates.</p>
<p>Having spent years observing courier operations, Halsey has developed an eye for exceptional talent. When Jack joins Aletheion, Halsey quickly recognises that his abilities far exceed those of typical new recruits. Rather than simply exploiting this talent, Halsey takes a more nurturing approach, carefully guiding Jack's advancement through the courier ranks.</p>
<p>Halsey's decision to promote Jack with unprecedented speed reflects both his recognition of Jack's extraordinary capabilities and his understanding of how to work within the corporate system to benefit deserving employees. He serves as a buffer between Jack and the more ruthless aspects of corporate politics, ensuring that Jack's advancement serves his interests as well as the company's.</p>
<p>The relationship between Halsey and Jack represents a more humane form of corporate mentorshipâ€”one where genuine recognition of ability is coupled with concern for the individual's development. Halsey's guidance helps Jack navigate the complex dynamics of corporate life whilst maintaining his integrity and sense of purpose.</p>
