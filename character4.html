                            <p>Albert and Dorothy Abbott were once ordinary people with modest dreams before falling into debt and becoming indentured workers at the GigaSource mining colony. Though the brutal conditions of the mine have broken them physically, they maintained a small pocket of love and protection for their son Jack amidst the harshness of their existence. They established a simple routine of silent meals together and gentle physical affection, creating what normalcy they could for their child. Despite their exhaustion and the grimness of their circumstances, they never stopped caring for Jack, representing the only source of genuine love in his life until their tragic deaths in an explosion caused by a sabotaged air filtration system.</p>

                                    <p>Their son is the center of their world and the recipient of what little love and comfort they can provide in the harsh environment of the mine.
