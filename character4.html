                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>Maya Lin was born into a family of interstellar traders who traversed the most dangerous and uncharted regions of space. From childhood, she displayed an uncanny spatial awareness and intuitive understanding of celestial navigation that surpassed even the most sophisticated AI systems.</p>
                            <p>When her family's trading vessel was seized by Fleet authorities on false smuggling charges, Maya was separated from her parents and conscripted into the Fleet Academy's navigation division. There she met Alex Mercer, and the two formed a close friendship based on their shared love of exploration and distaste for arbitrary authority.</p>
                            <p>After Alex was framed and Maya discovered evidence of the conspiracy against him, she used her position to help him escape before deserting herself. Now serving as the resistance's chief navigator, Maya's ability to plot courses through unmapped regions and dangerous territories has saved countless lives and enabled critical missions that would otherwise be impossible.</p>

                                    <p>Maya and Alex share a deep friendship forged during their Academy days and strengthened through adversity. She is one of the few people Alex trusts completely, and they operate with an almost telepathic understanding during flight operations.</p>

                                    <p>Maya initially distrusted Rook due to his background as a Fleet operative, but has gradually come to respect his skills and commitment to the cause. They share a dry sense of humor that helps lighten tense situations.</p>
