<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Dock Officer Bartram serves as a security officer at Horizon Outpost, responsible for processing incoming vessels and ensuring compliance with docking protocols. Unlike the brutal guards of the mining colony, Barty is kind-hearted and jovial, with a genuine concern for those he encounters. His compassionate nature is evident in his treatment of Jack upon the boy's arrival at the outpost, providing him with food, comfort, and official documentation that allows him freedom of movement. Though his time in the story is brief, Barty represents Jack's first encounter with genuine human kindness outside of his parents and serves as a bridge between Jack's past life of oppression and his future of possibility.</p>
