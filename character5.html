                            <p>Zephyr is a mysterious figure whose origins remain largely unknown even to their closest allies. They appeared suddenly during a critical moment in the resistance's early days, providing crucial intelligence that saved dozens of lives. Claiming to be the last guardian of an ancient order that once stewarded advanced technologies across the stars, Zephyr possesses knowledge of forgotten systems and devices that predate the current civilization.</p>
                            <p>Their body bears unusual markings and modifications that suggest either an alien origin or extensive bioengineering beyond current technological capabilities. Zephyr speaks in riddles and metaphors, often referring to historical events that have no record in any known database.</p>
                            <p>Despite the mystery surrounding their identity, Zephyr has proven their loyalty to the resistance countless times, offering guidance that seems almost prophetic in its accuracy. They appear to have a deeper understanding of the conflict than anyone else, hinting at stakes that go beyond the immediate struggle for freedom.</p>
