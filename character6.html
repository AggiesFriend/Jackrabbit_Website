                            <h3>Biography</h3>
                            <p>Rook was once the most feared operative in Commander Darius's elite enforcement division, known for his ruthless efficiency and perfect mission record. Raised in a military orphanage after his parents died in a border skirmish, Rook was molded from childhood to be the perfect soldier—disciplined, loyal, and unquestioning.</p>
                            <p>His defection to the resistance came after a mission to eliminate a supposed terrorist cell revealed that his targets were actually innocent civilians who had discovered corruption within the Fleet's supply chain. Unable to carry out his orders and unwilling to live any longer as an instrument of oppression, Rook faked his own death and sought out the resistance.</p>
                            <p>Initially met with suspicion and hostility, Rook gradually earned the trust of the resistance through his actions, putting his specialized combat and infiltration skills to use for their cause. He rarely speaks of his past, but carries the weight of his former deeds heavily, seeking redemption through each mission he completes for the resistance.</p>

                                <li><strong>Stolen Freedom</strong> - Rook joins the resistance late in the book, initially as an enigmatic figure whose true loyalties remain suspect.</li>
                                <li><strong>Wings of Freedom</strong> - Rook's background is explored more deeply as he takes on increasingly dangerous missions, using his intimate knowledge of Fleet operations to the resistance's advantage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Upcoming Book</strong> - Rook will face a direct confrontation with his former mentor, Commander Darius, forcing him to confront his past fully.</li>

                                    <h4>Commander Darius</h4>
                                    <p>Darius personally recruited and trained Rook, seeing in him the perfect protégé. Their relationship was almost paternal, making Rook's defection all the more painful for both parties. Rook still struggles with conflicted feelings about his former mentor.</p>

                                    <h4>Alex Mercer</h4>
                                    <p>Alex initially distrusted Rook completely, suspecting him of being a double agent. Over time, a grudging respect developed between them, though tensions still occasionally flare when their different approaches to problems clash.</p>

                                    <p>Maya was one of the first to give Rook a chance, recognizing the genuine remorse behind his stoic exterior. They've developed an unlikely friendship based on mutual respect and a shared dry sense of humor.</p>
