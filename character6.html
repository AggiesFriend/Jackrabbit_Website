                            <p>Brinn is a cheerful, well-fed boy approximately Jack's age who lives on Horizon Outpost. With his boisterous personality and boundless energy, he represents everything Jack was never allowed to be in the mining colony. Their chance meeting in the retail area leads to Brinn giving Jack an impromptu tour of the outpost's facilities, introducing him to showers, clothing shops, and most notably, the concept of laughter. Though their interaction is brief, Brinn's uninhibited joy and natural friendliness offer Jack a glimpse of normal childhood interactions and help him begin to adjust to life beyond mere survival.</p>

He embodies the outpost's more relaxed, community-orientated culture.</p>
