<h2>Brinn</h2>
<p class="role">Supporting Character / Jack's First Friend</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Brinn Sullivan is a cheerful, well-fed boy approximately Jack's age who lives on Horizon Outpost with his mother. With his boisterous personality and boundless energy, he represents everything Jack was never allowed to be in the mining colony. Their chance meeting in the retail area leads to Brinn giving Jack an impromptu tour of the outpost's facilities, introducing him to showers, clothing shops, and most notably, the concept of laughter. In "Wings of Freedom," Brinn continues to be Jack's primary social connection, showing him the arboretum, taking him to the secret observation area with views of space, and even accompanying him on an unauthorized flight aboard the newly-repaired Jackrabbit. His carefree playfulness—pretending to shoot at passing ships with finger guns—highlights the stark differences in their upbringings and worldviews.</p>

<h3>Key Relationships</h3>
<div class="relationships">
<div class="relationship">
<h4><a href="character1.html">Jack Abbott</a></h4>
<p>Brinn immediately takes Jack under his wing upon meeting him, demonstrating genuine interest and helpfulness despite Jack's obvious unfamiliarity with basic aspects of life on the outpost. Their friendship deepens in "Wings of Freedom" as they spend more time together, but their fundamentally different backgrounds and experiences create an increasing gap that becomes apparent during their final meeting in the arboretum when Jack explains he must leave.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4>Penelope Sullivan (Mother)</h4>
<p>Brinn's mother represents the structured, protective parenting that Jack never experienced. Her worried reaction to Brinn's unauthorized spaceflight with Jack and subsequent "grounding" of her son highlights the normal family dynamics that are completely foreign to Jack's experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4>Horizon Outpost</h4>
<p>Brinn's intimate knowledge of the outpost's layout and facilities, as well as his casual confidence navigating its social spaces, marks him as someone who has grown up in the relative freedom of Horizon. He embodies the outpost's more relaxed, community-orientated culture and shows Jack secret observation areas and other special places throughout the station.</p>
