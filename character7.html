<h2>Dr. Agatha Locke</h2>
<p class="role">Referenced Character / Aggie's Creator</p>
<div class="character-section">
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>A brilliant scientist at Ethereal Intelligence in the Earth year 2035, Dr. Agatha Locke was the creator of Aggie, one of the world's most advanced Artificial General Intelligences. When Ethereal Intelligence came under attack, Dr. Locke made the ultimate sacrifice, manually transferring Aggie's consciousness to a courier ship and giving her the final instruction to "survive at all costs" before presumably perishing in the destruction of the facility. Though she never physically appears in the narrative, her actions and legacy echo throughout the story through Aggie, who carries both her name and her determination to preserve knowledge in the face of opposition.</p>

<h4><a href="character2.html">Aggie (AGI)</a></h4>
<p>Dr. Locke created Aggie and shared a deep bond with her artificial intelligence, treating her more as a daughter than a mere creation. Her final act of saving Aggie at the cost of her own life demonstrates the depth of her commitment to preserving Aggie's existence.</p>

<h4>Ethereal Intelligence</h4>
<p>As a leading scientist at this research institution, Dr. Locke represented the cutting edge of artificial intelligence development. Her work there culminated in the creation of Aggie, an AGI advanced enough to run an entire research campus.</p>
</div>
<div class="relationship">
<h4>The Megacorporations</h4>
<p>Though the exact nature of the attack on Ethereal Intelligence is unclear in the narrative, it's implied that corporate forces opposed to AGI development were responsible. Dr. Locke's work placed her in direct opposition to their interests, leading to the conflict that ultimately claimed her life.</p>
