                            <p>Gilbert was an undercover operative working for a resistance movement against the megacorporations. He infiltrated the mining colony with a dual mission: to sabotage the operation and to recover a "valuable asset" that intelligence suggested was hidden near the facility â€“ unknowingly referring to Aggie's crashed ship. Though his screen time is brief, Gilbert's actions set the entire story in motion. He damaged the air filtration system, creating the conditions for the later explosion that would claim the lives of Jack's parents, and more importantly, he carried the IFF device that would eventually lead Jack to discover Aggie. His public execution by Victor Drayton serves as Jack's introduction to the brutality of the colony's regime and provides the catalyst for Jack's discovery of the device that changes his life forever.</p>

His death and the dropping of the IFF device that Jack retrieves serve as the inciting incident of the narrative.</li>

                                    <h4>The Resistance</h4>
                                    <p>Gilbert was a committed operative of a resistance movement fighting against the megacorporations' oppressive control. His mission to the mining colony was part of this larger struggle, suggesting an organized opposition exists beyond the immediate setting of the story.</p>

                                    <h4>Jack Abbott</h4>
                                    <p>Though they never directly interact, Gilbert's actions profoundly affect Jack's life. The IFF device he carried becomes Jack's key to discovering Aggie, while the sabotage he initiated ultimately leads to the explosion that claims Jack's parents, forcing the boy to seek escape from the colony.</p>

                                    <h4>Aggie</h4>
                                    <p>Unknown to Gilbert, the "valuable asset" he was sent to recover was Aggie. His mission suggests that some elements of the resistance were aware of Aggie's existence and location, recognizing her potential value in their struggle against the megacorporations.</p>

                                    <h4>Victor Drayton</h4>
                                    <p>Gilbert's capture and public execution serve as a demonstration of Drayton's absolute power over the colony. The resistance operative's defiance even in the face of death offers a stark contrast to Drayton's cruel and capricious rule.</p>
