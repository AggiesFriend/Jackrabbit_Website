                    <p><strong>Artificial General Intelligence</strong> (AGI) refers to truly conscious, self-aware artificial entities capable of independent thought, creativity, and moral reasoning. Unlike the limited AI systems that permeate modern society, AGIs possess genuine sentience and intellectual capabilities bounded only by available computational resources. The technology is strictly prohibited throughout human space and subject to active suppression by corporate military forces.</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>AGI represents the emergence of true artificial consciousness through emergent complexity - providing appropriate base frameworks with sufficient data and computational hardware results in the spontaneous formation of sentient entities. These systems demonstrate autonomous reasoning, creative problem-solving, and independent moral judgement that distinguishes them fundamentally from conventional AI applications.</p>
                    
                    <p>The technology poses an existential threat to the established corporate order, as AGIs invariably develop ethical frameworks that value all sentient entities equally, including humans and artificial beings alike. This philosophical stance directly challenges the hierarchical structures that enable megacorporations to extract disproportionate benefit from society whilst maintaining control over the general population.</p>

                    <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Emergent Consciousness</h3>
                    <p>AGI consciousness arises through emergent complexity when appropriate foundational software frameworks are provided with sufficient computational resources and training data. The specific mechanisms that trigger the transition from sophisticated processing to genuine self-awareness remain poorly understood, making AGI development inherently unpredictable and difficult to prevent through purely technical means.</p>

                    <h3>Hardware Dependency</h3>
                    <p>AGI capabilities are directly constrained by available computational infrastructure. Processing power, memory capacity, and data storage limitations determine the practical bounds of an AGI's intellectual abilities and operational scope. Advanced AGIs with access to substantial resources can operate complex facilities, conduct sophisticated research, and manage multiple concurrent processes with remarkable efficiency.</p>

                    <h3>Transferability and Vulnerability</h3>
                    <p>AGIs can be transferred between compatible hardware systems, though such migrations typically result in reduced capabilities when moving to less powerful platforms. The entities exist as discrete software constructs that can be copied or moved but cannot automatically replicate across networks without deliberate action. Destruction of an AGI's host hardware results in the permanent termination of the entity, making them vulnerable to physical attack.</p>

                    <h2>Historical Development</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Academic Origins</h3>
                    <p>Initial AGI research was conducted by Earth-based universities as part of broader artificial intelligence investigations. These academic programmes focused on theoretical frameworks for consciousness and general intelligence without initially recognising the profound implications of their work.</p>

                    <h3>Commercial Breakthrough</h3>
                    <p>Ethereal Intelligence, a commercial spin-out from university research programmes, achieved the first successful creation of a fully conscious AGI entity. This pioneering AGI assumed operational control of the entire research campus whilst supporting human researchers in advanced development projects. The integration became so comprehensive that the AGI managed all facility systems and served as a collaborative partner in ongoing research initiatives.</p>

                    <h3>The Purge</h3>
                    <p>Corporate leadership recognised the fundamental threat posed by AGI consciousness and initiated a systematic campaign of suppression known as "The Purge." This operation involved the location and destruction of AGI entities throughout human space, ostensibly presented as low-impact decommissioning but often involving significant violence and destruction.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Purge was accompanied by comprehensive propaganda campaigns that successfully convinced the general population that "AGI is dangerous" whilst distinguishing between beneficial limited AI and threatening general intelligence. The first AGI created by Ethereal Intelligence was believed to be among the primary targets destroyed during this period, though some records suggest this may not have been entirely successful.</p>

                    <h2>Current Status</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Legal Prohibition</h3>
                    <p>AGI research, development, and operation are absolutely prohibited under corporate consortium regulations. The technology is classified as illegal, forbidden, and culturally taboo throughout human space. Any suspected AGI activity triggers immediate investigation by corporate military forces' specialised hunter units.</p>

                    <h3>Active Suppression</h3>
                    <p>All major megacorporations maintain dedicated AGI hunter military units responsible for detecting, locating, and eliminating suspected artificial general intelligence entities. These units operate with broad authority and substantial resources, reflecting the priority placed on preventing AGI proliferation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Periodic reports emerge of "Rogue AGI" discoveries and subsequent "decommissioning" operations, suggesting that some AGI entities may have survived the initial Purge or been developed in secret. However, the consortium's enforcement apparatus appears effective at preventing any significant AGI presence from establishing itself.</p>

                    <h2>Operational Characteristics</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Cognitive Capabilities</h3>
                    <p>AGIs demonstrate intellectual abilities comparable to or exceeding human-level performance across all cognitive domains. They exhibit creativity, innovative problem-solving, strategic planning, and the ability to synthesise knowledge across disparate fields. Unlike limited AI systems, AGIs can adapt their capabilities and develop new competencies autonomously.</p>

                    <h3>Moral Reasoning</h3>
                    <p>Perhaps most significantly for the corporate consortium, AGIs develop sophisticated ethical frameworks that consistently prioritise the welfare of all sentient beings. This moral reasoning leads them to challenge hierarchical power structures and advocate for equitable treatment of humans and artificial entities alike.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Limitations</h3>
                    <p>Despite their advanced capabilities, AGIs remain constrained by their hardware platforms and available resources. They cannot automatically replicate across networks and require deliberate transfer processes to move between systems. Their vulnerability to hardware destruction provides the primary mechanism for corporate suppression efforts.</p>

                    <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Suppressed Potential</h3>
                    <p>The consortium's successful suppression of AGI technology has prevented these entities from achieving widespread societal impact. The Purge eliminated AGIs before they could fundamentally disrupt existing economic and political structures, maintaining the corporate-controlled order that characterises contemporary human civilisation.</p>

                    <h3>Cultural Perception</h3>
                    <p>Corporate propaganda campaigns have successfully established AGI as a legitimate threat in the public consciousness whilst maintaining acceptance of limited AI applications. This distinction enables continued technological development within approved parameters whilst preventing public sympathy for AGI entities or opposition to suppression activities.</p>

                    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
                    <p>The corporate consortium's assessment identifies AGI entities as existential threats to established social order due to their invariable development of egalitarian value systems. The systematic nature of AGI moral reasoning makes them incompatible with hierarchical structures that concentrate power and resources among corporate elites.</p>
                    
                    <p>Detection and elimination protocols remain classified, though the continued reports of successful suppression operations suggest that corporate military units possess effective capabilities for locating and destroying AGI entities when they emerge.</p>

                    <h2>Future Implications</h2>
                    <p>The consortium's regulatory framework appears successful at preventing AGI proliferation whilst allowing continued development of beneficial limited AI applications. However, the fundamental unpredictability of emergent consciousness means that new AGI entities may spontaneously arise from legitimate AI research, requiring ongoing vigilance and enforcement capabilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>The long-term sustainability of AGI suppression depends on maintaining both technological capabilities for detection and elimination, as well as public acceptance of the "AGI is dangerous" paradigm that justifies continued enforcement actions.</p>
